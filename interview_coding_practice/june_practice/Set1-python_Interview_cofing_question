Problem - 1:Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
**Example:**
Input: `"abcabcbb"` → Output: `3` (`"abc"`)
Logic:
Slide a window though the string, keep track of character you have seen so far.
if you see a dublicate, move the start of the window ahead to skip the repeat.
keep updating the longest length you found so far

Input: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]` → Output: `4` (sequence: `[1,2,3,4]`)

---
Problem - 9 :**3Sum
Given an integer array `nums`, find all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that they sum to zero.
**Example:**
Input: `[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`
Output: `[[-1,-1,2], [-1,0,1]]`

---
Problem - 10:**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which contains all the characters in `t`.
**Example:**
Input: `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`
Output: `"BANC"`

---

Problem - 11:** Merge Intervals
Merge Intervals
Given a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
Input:  [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Logic: This is a Sort + merge overlapping application
1. sort all the interval by their start time
2. Start with first interval, then check the next one
    - if they overlap, merge them into one bigger interval - check if 2nd value of last interval is >= 1st of the next interval
    - if they don't keep them separate
3. Continue until done

Problem - 12:** Subarray Sum Equals K
Question: Count how many continuous subarrays sum to k.
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2  # ([1,1] at index 0–1 and index 1–2)
Logic: Running sum + hashmap
1- Use a running sum to keep track of the total so far.
2. Use a dictionary to count how often each sum has appeared
3. For each new element, check if ( current sum - k ) has appeared befor - if yes then you found a sub-array


Problem - 13:** Find First Missing Positive
Question: Find the smallest missing positive integer.
Example:
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Logic:
1.

Problem - 14:** Rotate Image (Matrix)
Question: Rotate an N x N matrix 90° clockwise in place.
Example:
Input:  [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],
         [8,5,2],
         [9,6,3]]
Logic:
* imagine a square grid, like a picture on a paper.
* To rotate it 90° clockwise, you can do it in two simple steps:
1. Transpose the matrix:
    - swap row into column
    - for every cell(i,j), swap it with (j,i)
2. Reverse each rows
    - Flip each row left to right

Problem - 15:** Word Break
Question: Can the string be segmented into dictionary words?
Example:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: True
Logic:
* Imagine you have a sentence with no space, like "leetcode".
* you also have a list of valid words, like ["leet", "code"].
* You want to check if you can bereak the sentence into words only from the dictionary
* To do this, you check each possible way to split the sentence:
    - For each postition in the string, check if the part before it is valid and if remaining part can also split
* Use dynamic programming to avoid repeating work:
    - make a dp list where dp[i] means "Can I split the first i letters?”
    - Start with dp[0] = True (empty string can always be split).
    - For each end position i, check all possible start position j before i
    - if dp[j] is True and dp[j:i] is a word in the dictionary then dp[i] id true



Problem - 16: **Validate Binary Search Tree
Question: Check if a binary tree is a valid BST.
Example:
nput: [2,1,3]
Output: True
Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: False
Logic:


Problem - 16: **Find Peak Element
Question: Find a peak element (greater than neighbors).
Example:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2  # Index of peak element 3
Logic:
1. A peak is an element greater than its neighbour
2. Use binary search
    - if middle is less than its right neighbour, search right
    - Else search left


Problem - 17: **Product of Array Except Self
Question: Return array where each element is the product of all other elements.
Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Logic: Two-pass prefix & suffix products
1. Make a result array
2. for each element multiply all elements to its left and right
3. Do it in two passes( left product and right product without using division)

Problem - 18: ** Three sum
Given an array of integers nums, find all unique triplets (a, b, c) such that:
Logic:
- First sort the array to avoid the duplicate number
- Fixed the first number (a) and use two pointers to find pairs ( b and c) such that their sum is -a
- Skip duplicates for all three numbers to unsure unique truples.
