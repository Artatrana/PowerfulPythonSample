I'll create several Python programs showcasing complex concepts, each under 100 lines. These will demonstrate advanced
Python features and programming patterns.I've created 4 advanced Python programs, each under 100 lines, demonstrating
complex concepts:

## 🚀 **Program 1: Advanced Decorators**
- **Complex Concepts**: Function composition, TTL caching, exponential backoff
- **Features**: Smart caching with statistics, retry logic with backoff
- **Real-world Use**: API rate limiting, expensive computation caching

## 🔧 **Program 2: Context Managers & Resource Management**
- **Complex Concepts**: Nested context managers, threading locks, resource lifecycle
- **Features**: Transaction-like operations, automatic cleanup, thread-safe resource tracking
- **Real-world Use**: Database transactions, file handling, connection pooling

## 🏗️ **Program 3: Metaclasses & Descriptor Protocol**
- **Complex Concepts**: Metaclass programming, descriptor protocol, weak references
- **Features**: Automatic validation, dynamic property creation, memory-efficient storage
- **Real-world Use**: ORM models, data validation frameworks, API serialization

## ⚡ **Program 4: Advanced Async Patterns**
- **Complex Concepts**: Semaphores, concurrent task management, mixed async/sync execution
- **Features**: Rate limiting, progress monitoring, batch processing
- **Real-world Use**: Web scraping, API bulk operations, concurrent data processing

## 🎯 **Key Advanced Concepts Covered:**

### **Memory Management**
- Weak references in descriptors
- Resource cleanup and lifecycle management

### **Concurrency**
- Threading locks and semaphores
- Async/await patterns with rate limiting

### **Metaprogramming**
- Custom metaclasses
- Descriptor protocol implementation
- Dynamic method generation

### **Functional Programming**
- Higher-order functions and decorators
- Function composition and chaining

### **Design Patterns**
- Context manager protocol
- Observer pattern in progress monitoring
- Factory pattern in metaclass construction

Each program is production-ready and demonstrates real-world applications of these advanced concepts.
You can run them individually or together to see all the complex Python features in action!
