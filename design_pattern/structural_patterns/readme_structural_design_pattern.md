## Structural Design Patterns
### Overview
Structural design pattern focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger, 
flexible, and maintainable structure. Instead of creating everything form scratch, these patterns
help you reuse existing components, integrated legacy systems, and manage complexity.

The answer the questions like:
* How do we connect different classes cleanly?
* How do we extend behavior without modifying the existing code?
* How do we simplify complex systems?

Why Structural Patterns Matter
* Promote loose coupling 
* Improve code readability and maintainability 
* Help integrate third-pary and legacy systems
* Reduce the impact of changes in large systems

Structural patterns are commonly seen in frameworks, libraries, APIs, and system design.


### List of Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter 
2. Decorator 
3. Facade
4. Composite 
5. Proxy 

### Conclusion
Structural Design Patterns are foundational to modern software development. They are heavily used in frameworks, cloud SDKs, middleware, and large‑scale systems to manage complexity while keeping the codebase clean and extensible.
Understanding these patterns helps you write better code and communicate design decisions effectively in interviews and real‑world projects.
