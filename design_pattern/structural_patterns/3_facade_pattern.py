# 3. Facade Pattern
# Intent : Provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
# Real world analogy: A remote control that hides all complexity of a TV, speakers, and set‑top box.
# Real Applications:
#  - Spring Boot starters
#  - AWS SDKs (S3, EC2 APIs)

# When to use it:
# - Simplifying complex API
# - Reducing dependencies between client and subsystems
# - Improving usability of libraries
