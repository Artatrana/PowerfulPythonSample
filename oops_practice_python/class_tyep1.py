# We create python class for all different reason. Below list of 15 reason for which a python class
# can be created. Python is fully object oriented language. All objects have identity which is address,
# Type - which define a python object and its value or states which we can change.
# With list of 15 type of class - we create python object though class - the class are themselves objects.
# These are act as factory - though which we create object. Object can be created though these class.

# The main 15 types of class
# 1. To represent real world things
# 2. To bundle Data+Functions Together ( Encapsulation)
# 3. Create Multiple object from same Template
# 4. To maintain State Across Methods Call # I don't know this
# 5. To improve code organization ( Modular Design )
# 6. To support Inharitance (Reuse Existing Code)
# 7. To support Polymerphism( Same name, Different Implementation)
# 8. To Create Custome Data Type
# 9. To Hide Internal Implementation ( Abstraction)
# 10. To Maintain Clean Large-Scale Codebases
# 11. To Use Features Like Magic Methods ( Operator Overloading)
# 12. To Create Reusable Components/Frameworks
# 13. To Implement Design Patterns
# 14. To Manage Resource ( Context Mangers)
# 15. To Create Packages/Libraries/SDKs
